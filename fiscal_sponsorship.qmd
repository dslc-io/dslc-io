title: "Fiscal Sponsorship"
---

The Data Science Learning Community is a fiscally sponsored project of the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.foundation/) (OCF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
Fiscal sponsorship allows us to collect tax-deductible donations without the overhead of a full nonprofit organization.
However, the OCF is dissolving, and we are currently unable to accept donations.

We are actively seeking a new fiscal sponsor. If you have information about a fiscal host that you believe we should look into, please [contact us](mailto:rfordatasci@gmail.com).
