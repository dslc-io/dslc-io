The **Data Science Learning Community** is a diverse, friendly, and inclusive community of data science learners and practitioners.

We launched in August 2017 as the R4DS Online Learning Community, a supportive and responsive online space for learners and mentors to gather and work through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund[^story-1].

[^story-1]: They actually read the [first edition](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, but we recommend you stick with the more up-to-date 2e!

The group has grown from that initial club into a community of thousands of learners.
