    "text": "Question: Why did you change your name?\nAnswer: We wanted a name that caused less confusion.\nWe launched in 2017 as an online space for learners and mentors to gather to read R for Data Science (R4DS) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund together. The name “R4DS Online Learning Community” made sense for that group.\nHowever, we now support much more than just that one book.\n\n\nQuestion: Are you changing your focus from R to Python?\nAnswer: No! We seek to support all data science learners.\nWe began with R, our internal tools are written in R, and many of our users, book clubs and channels focus on R. However, we know that data scientists use many languages in their day-to-day work, including Python, Julia, SQL, and others. We want to help data science learners learn all of the skills they need, regardless of whether those skills involve R, Python, Julia, SQL, JavaScript, or no programming language at all.\n\n\nQuestion: Aren’t you just a book club for R for Data Science?\nAnswer: No! We support over fifty books and at least four programming languages!\nWe began with R for Data Science because it is a great book for beginners. But we host book clubs for many other R book (such as Advanced R, Mastering Shiny, and Tidy Modeling with R), and even other programming languages (such as Python for Data Analysis and Fundamentals of Numerical Computation with Julia).\n\n\nQuestion: Are you part of (Posit, Google, etc)?\nAnswer: No! We are an independent organization.\nGoogle mentions us in their Data Analytics Certificate courses, and we received a donation from Posit in our former incarnation as the R4DS Online Learning Community. However, we are not affiliated with either organization."

What have you already tried? What error messages are you seeing (exactly, not paraphrased)? How is the output not what you’d expect?\nPost the minimal setup needed to expose the problem, if you can. Removing unrelated data and code will help us get to the core of your issue faster. Provide a small illustrative sample data frame and refer to its columns and values in your question.\nMake it runnable, if you can. Others should be able to copy and paste the code you post and run it in their own R session (assuming the right packages are installed, as identified in a library() call in your code). Investigate the reprex package. Use dput to create runnable versions of R objects, or build easy-to-read tibbles with tribble.\nFormat for readability, using Slack’s mini-markdown capabilities. Identify embedded snippets of R code by enclosing in single backticks (`). Example: My favorite tidyverse function is mutate. And format chunks of R code by enclosing multiple lines with pairs of triple-backticks (tip: ctrl+Enter puts a newline in your Slack post):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntdf &lt;- tribble(\n  ~foo, ~bar,\n  1, 2\n  3, 4\n)\nFor more ideas on posting questions/issues effectively, have a look at this Posit Community guide, and the Issues Appendix from Tidyteam code review principles."
