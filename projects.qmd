We encourage learners to share their work with the Community. 

## TidyTuesday

[TidyTuesday](https://tidytues.day) is a weekly social data project.
We post a new dataset every week at [tidytues.day](https://tidytues.day), and encourage learners to explore the data and share their insights on social media using the `#TidyTuesday` hashtag.
Our over-arching goal for TidyTuesday is to make learning to work with data easier, by providing real-world datasets.

## Project Club

Project Club is a monthly online meetup, in which a Community member presents something they are working on or something they find interesting.
[Videos of most Project Club meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGgRuMQogeHX0UTrGY_Ri6Y_) are available on the [DSLC.video](https://DSLC.video) YouTube channel.
Everyone is invited to participate!
